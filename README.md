# Personal base.user.css modifications for Typora

For each stuff/css change, there is its own file in `base.user.css.d` folder.

I make use of import statements to put them into main css file, and thus I can easily comment out things I don't want without bothering about large blocks of css.

See `base.user.css` for an example.
