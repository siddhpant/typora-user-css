/* 
 * For auto numbering of headings in content. 
 * Source: https://support.typora.io/Auto-Numbering/
 * 
 * Custom added counter for figure numbers using fignum
 * class. Figure number would be like: <h1>.<fignum>.
 * So one can use "Figure <span class="fignum"></span>".
 * 
 * Same has been done for table ("tablenum").
 *
 * Sometimes we may want to refer to the figure or table,
 * so h1 count is exposed using the class "hnum".
